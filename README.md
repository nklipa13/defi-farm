Your virtual pets that work for you and will die to save your defi positions!


aSaver - A type of NFT that will eat your Dai and store in their belly.
This will earn you pasive interest over time which you can exit at anytime by sacrificing your aSaver.

aTraders- A type of NFT that will eat your Eth and all in, with a leverage!
This is a really risky animal that might be killed in the price crashed but can earn you money quickly!
